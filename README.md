**Introduction ** 

The attached application note attempts to help users more quickly understand and begin using the Q  
programming language from Applied Motion Products.  

If you are completely new to Q programming, a three-part online video series covers drive  
configuration and programming basics.  

â€¢ Part 1 - https://youtu.be/qvN5T2bXfKQ  
â€¢ Part 2 - https://youtu.be/mxi8sN7T_jU  
â€¢ Part 3 - https://youtu.be/omM0qf1wwZg  

A full list of Q commands, parameters and data registers can be found in the Host Command  
Reference: https://appliedmotion.s3.amazonaws.com/Host-Command-Reference_920-0002W_0.pdf

The Q Programmer software is included with many of our configuration applications, such as  
Step-Servo Quick Tuner and SVX Servo Suite. Which configuration software you use depends  
on the hardware you have. A stand-alone version of Q Programmer is also available. All  
software applications from Applied Motion Products can be downloaded for free from our  
website: https://www.applied-motion.com/products/software  

Provided below is a short description of the difference between Q segments and programs.  
Example segments and programs accompanying this application note can be found on our  
website by downloading APPN0051: https://www.applied-motion.com/support/application-notes  

Q Segments  
Q segments are discrete sections of the larger Q program. There are a total of 12 segments in a  
Q program. Each segment can be loaded into the Q Programmer software individually and has  
the file extension .qsg. The Q segment examples provided with this application note are useful  
to understand move commands as well as the basics of looping, handling inputs and branching.  

To run a Q segment, open a .qsg file by clicking the Open button within the desired segment tab  
of Q Programmer. See Image 1. Click the Download button to download the segment followed  
by the Execute button to execute it.

Q Programs  
Q programs contain a total of 12 Q segments and enable users to organize the Q program to  
best fit their needs. For example, it may be best to devote each segment to a single task. Or it  
may be better to string multiple segments together to create one long program. Q programs  
have the file extension .qpr. To open a Q program, click the File menu in Q Programmer then  
Open Program. See Image 2. Click Download Program to download the program (all 12  
segments) and then Execute to execute the program starting with segment 1. The Q program  
examples provided with this application note are useful for learning more complicated  
functionality and how to program across multiple segments.

Conclusion  
Example Q segments and programs are provided with this application note to help users get up  
and running quickly and efficiently with Q Programmer. All examples are commented and ready  
to be executed with few or no changes required.
